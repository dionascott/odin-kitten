# Odin Kitten

This is a fast and straightforward project where you'll set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API... which is just a fancy way of saying that all your controller methods will render data instead of HTML. Consider this a drill in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. We won't be working with an external API until the second project.
